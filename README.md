# CS_410P_chip8
Final project for Rust (CS410P) - Chip 8 Interpreter

I created a [chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter a few years ago in javascript. It was really slow and had a blinky sprite bug, so I always wanted to redo it. Rust seems like a great language for this sort of thing.

This project is for an elective course I am taking at PSU (CS410P - Rust).
